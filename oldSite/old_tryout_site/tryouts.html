    <center><h1>Team Tryout Information</h1></center>
        <br>
        <h2>What?</h2>
        <p>For the first time, the Holy Ghost Prep robotics team is implementing team tryouts. 
            All members need to try out for the team, and will then be admitted as either Varsity
            or Junior Varsity status (explained below). 
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>We are earnestly seeking to become the top VEX robotics program in the state, and one of the more
            competitive programs in the world. To do so, we need to begin with personnel. No one will be
            turned away from the team, but only the top students will be selected as Varsity members. We need to 
            know that they possess the skills to help the team succeed, and that they are willing to
            commit their time and effort to seeing us meet our team goals. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>When?</h2>
        <p>Tryouts will be on the evenings of May 23rd and May 30th. </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Who?</h2>
        <p>Anyone from incoming 9th graders to 12th graders at Holy Ghost Prep, or Villa Joseph Marie,
            are welcome to try out for the team (so this includes current 8th graders who will be in one 
            of these schools in Fall 2019).
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>How?</h2>
        <p> Each student needs to sign up on the form below, and choose a 1.5 hour time slot. Each student will also
          need to purchase, and bring with them, a pair of safety glasses (Example here: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003UYGR78/ref=twister_B01G93S8DM?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1">LINK</a>)
          to wear at the tryouts. These will remain the 
          property of the student, but will stay in the lab during their time on the team (students 
          will also be bringing them to all competitions). Students can bring their own laptops to 
          the tryouts, but are not required to do so, since laptops will be provided for them.

            <h2>TO PREPARE:</h2>
            <p> Tryouts will consist of 1.5 hours of designing, building, and programming a VEX machine. You will 
              also be quizzed on the game "Tower Takeover". In order
              to prep for this, students should complete the following:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Review the game manual for "Tower Takeover"(<a href="https://content.vexrobotics.com/docs/vrc-tower-takeover/GameManual.pdf">LINK</a>)</li>
              <li>Read about how to document your design process. (Links: <a href="https://curriculum.vexrobotics.com/curriculum/intro-to-engineering/engineering-design-teams.html">Link1</a>, <a href="https://curriculum.vexrobotics.com/curriculum/intro-to-engineering/what-is-the-engineering-design-process.html">Link2</a>, <a href="https://curriculum.vexrobotics.com/curriculum/intro-to-engineering/design-documentation.html">Link3</a>)</li>
              <li>Download VEXcode and watch the videos on how to program, design, and build, robots. (<a href = "https://www.vexforum.com/t/vexcode-preview/58625">DOWNLOAD LINK</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkxYWAc7IzT7ABSxRRURtiZHimFKlMJys">Youtube Tutorial Video Playlist</a>)</li>
              <li>Review how to build VEX robots properly. (Videos are a part of the Playlist linked above)</li>
              <li>On May 26th, anyone is welcome to come to the Innovation Lab from 2 to 3 PM to see the VEX parts in person, and ask any other questions that you may have about tryouts (or the team in general).</li>
              <li>Each student will be judged on the following: design documentation, 
                building technique and efficiency, programming comments/flow/functionality, and "Tower Takeover" knowledge. </li>

          <h2>VARSITY VS. J.VARSITY</h2>
          <p><b>Varsity:</b> The varsity team will be building 5 robots for the 2019-2020 VEX season, and will 
            consist of the students who scored highest across all categories in tryouts. Each robot will be built by 
            3 to 5 students. Students will be putting in 
          an incredible amount of effort/time for the majority of the school year. The season will last from September 
        through April, and in that time, students will attend 5 to 7 weekend competitions (including overnight competitions). They 
      are expected to make an effort to be at every competition. </p>
      <br>
          <p><b>Junior Varsity:</b> This group will consist of all students who did not make the Varsity team. Students will 
          be placed on groups of 5 to 7 students each, and there will be more of a learning atmosphere. Attendance is more relaxed, and 
          students will attend 2 to 3 competitions throughout the season. Students will become 
        familiar with the VEX robotics platform, and how to build competition robots. There will be more guided instruction, and 
      helping students follow the design process while they design/build/program. This is a great way to learn about robotics, without 
    the pressure to perform well in a competitive environment. </p>

        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <p><b>Q: Is there a fee associated with this club?</b><br>A: While there is no fee to tryout for the team, there is 
          a fee to participate during the school year. This changes from year-to-year, and more information will go out to parents 
        once the team members are selected. The fee will be the same for Varsity and Junior Varsity members, and normally includes a team shirt.</p>
          <br>

        <p><b>Q: What if I don't have a lot of time for this club?</b><br>A: Then the Junior Varsity team is a great place
        for you! You have more freedom for when you can meet, and the requirements to remain on the team 
        are less stringent.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Q: What if I can't make the tryouts?</b><br>A: The only way to be admitted to the team  is 
        through the team tryouts at the beginning of the summer. We are no longer admitting new members mid-season. You will 
        need to contact the coach directly to try and reschedule your tryout. All tryouts for the season will 
        be closed a week after the first tryouts begin.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Q: What if I am already on the team?</b><br>A: In short, you are not on the team. The team roster
        resets every year, and you need to re-tryout to remain on the team. There is no guarantee that you will
        make Varsity each year, no guarantee that you will be placed on a team with the same members, and no 
        guarantee that you will be the same team letter. We are trying to make sure that the skills members bring
        to the team complement each other in a way that will lead to more team success overall. </p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Q: When will I know my team status?</b><br>A: The full list of members, Varsity and Junior Varsity, will be released on 
            this website a week after the first night of tryouts.</p>
            <br>
        <p><b>Q: Why are there tryouts now? We haven't done this in the past and we were just fine.</b><br>A: Yes, the 
        team was just fine, and had some moderate success, but the possibility of having 'moderate success' is not why 
        we are not investing hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars into this program. We are continuing to strive 
        to be better, and this is the next step in that journey.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Q: What if I have other questions that were not addressed here?</b><br>A: You can direct all other questions or
      concerns to the VEX Robotics Head Coach, Mr. Brandon Petcaugh (<i>bpetcaugh@holyghostprep.org</i>).
