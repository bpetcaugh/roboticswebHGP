                  <p class="card-text">Thanks to head coach Brandon Petcaugh and a group of truly gifted and dedicated students, Holy Ghost Prep’s robotics program is already one of the best in the state, as evidenced by HGP’s second-place finish out of 74 competing teams at the 2018 state championships.

                        In VEX robotics, teams of students are tasked with designing and building a robot to play against other teams in a game-based engineering challenge. In these challenges, STEM concepts are put to the test as students learn lifelong skills in teamwork, leadership, and communications. Tournaments are held year-round at the regional, state, and national levels and culminate at the VEX Robotics World Championship each April.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Last year robotics began at HGP with 4 teams, and 15 students. We ended that season with 2 trophies, and 2nd place at the state championship. This season we experienced a lot of team growth and a lot of success. We currently have 35 students on the team, and last weekend we competed with 8 different robots at the PA Eastern State Championship. Here are some of the awards the team earned this season:

                                242Z - Judges Award, Sportsmanship Award (x2)
                                242D - Robot Skills
                                242B - Build Award
                                242A - Tournament Champions, Amaze Award</p>

                              <p class="card-text">The event last weekend had numerous problems, from a snow delay to hours of technical issues, but at the end of the day the team had some notable accomplishments. Out of 86 teams, we had three of our teams in the top 20, and #242A ended the day in 4th place. Five of our teams qualified for the elimination rounds, and #242A made it to the Quarter Finals (one win away from a ticket to the world championship). See below for some of our awards. [#242B won the Build Award, for a well-crafted robot, but are not pictured because they were not present to accept the award.]</p>

                                    <p class="card-text">The HGP Robotics team has several events in the off-season. We will be hosting programming and CAD lessons for the team in the next few weeks. The #242A and #242D teams will be participating in the U S. Open Robotics Championship in early April, and that event will be webcast (a link will be sent out). The World Championship is taking place in Louisville, Kentucky at the end of April, after which we will begin building for the next challenge. Finally, there is also a plan to host team-building activities over the next several months. Stay tuned, and thanks for all of your support over the course of the season!
